            <h2>Engineer of Enabling</h2>
            <p>Team player, leader, everything in between.</p>
        </header>
        <p> It all started with just about any job right out of university; I just wanted to get a job, get
            paid, and live.
            I moved to the high desert and started my career at the Department of Defense.
            However, life had other plans. I was paired with my new technical lead and he was truly an
            engineer of passion;
            he had a love for the craft that changed my world view almost instantly. What started as a "9-5"
            routine
            became "6-3"; early mornings, endless work, and we all did it to advance our technological
            boundaries at the time.
            We pushed for cloud infrastructure, container orcehestration, proper CICD, all in the face of
            uncertainty and doubt.
            We enabled remote work for our small sector of engineers faster than the standard acquisition
            time. It was a golden era
            of endless learning and execution. I walked away from here with passion for the craft of DevOps.
        </p>
        <p> My next adventure took me to Utah to work for my first startup, MX Technologies. We were a
            passionate group that
            wanted to "empower the world to be financially strong". I hadn't resonated with a company
            mission as much
            as I did up until that point. I remembered leading a coding workshop early on with children from
            K-12 and leaving them with an application that would caculate how much to save from their
            paychecks
            in order to pay their taxes at the end of the year. I bet those kids thought it was pretty lame,
            but
            I wanted to leave them with something useful. It was a great 2 years and I accomplished so much
            with my
            team; we upgraded our binary storage to S3 (which enabled our Kubernetes team), we kept the
            platform up to our
            projected SLAs of 99.9% uptime, and we began our movement into a hybrid cloud infrastructure
            system with GCP. Later on, I joined the
            ongoing efforts of onboarding many of our Docker applications onto our Kubernetes cluster.
        </p>
        <p> The next chapter of my life took me back to the defense sector at Rebellion Defense. An old
            manager I trust
            reached out wanting to collaborate once more in the defense space. We both knew it had its
            challenges, but we
            were determined to make waves in a sector that craves innovation. While my time was brief at
            Rebellion, I felt as
            if my impact was known. During my tenure, I was part of every offline and online deployment of
            our Software-as-a-Service
            offering, flying to and from customer sites to ensure a frictionless deployment; I helped
            migrate portions of our Gitlab
            Infrastructure-as-Code to GitHub; I collaborated with the InfoSec and Engineering teams to
            improve and iterate on our deployment
            process.
        </p>
        <p> What's next? Well, that chapter has yet to be written!
