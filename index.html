										<h2>Engineer of Enabling</h2>
										<p>Team player, leader, everything in between.</p>
									</header>
									<p>     It all started with just about any job right out of university; I just wanted to get a job, get paid, and live. 
                                        I moved to the high desert and started my career at the Department of Defense.
                                        However, life had other plans. I was paired with my new technical lead and he was truly an engineer of passion; 
                                        he had a love for the craft that changed my world view almost instantly. What started as a "9-5" routine 
                                        became "6-3"; early mornings, endless work, and we all did it to advance our technological boundaries at the time. 
                                        We pushed for cloud infrastructure, container orcehestration, proper CICD, all in the face of uncertainty and doubt.
                                    We enabled remote work for our small sector of engineers faster than the standard acquisition time. It was a golden era 
                                of endless learning and execution. I walked away from here with passion for the craft of DevOps.</p>
                                <p>     My next adventure took me to Utah to work for my first startup, MX Technologies. We were a passionate group that 
                                    wanted to "empower the world to be financially strong". I hadn't resonated with a company mission as much
                                    as I did up until that point. I remembered leading a coding workshop early on with children from
                                    K-12 and leaving them with an application that would caculate how much to save from their paychecks
                                    in order to pay their taxes at the end of the year. I bet those kids thought it was pretty lame, but
                                    I wanted to leave them with something useful. It was a great 2 years and I accomplished so much with my
                                    team; we upgraded our binary storage to S3 (which enabled our Kubernetes team), we kept the platform up to our
                                    projected SLAs of 99.9% uptime, and we began our movement into a hybrid cloud infrastructure system with GCP. Later on, I joined the
                                    ongoing efforts of onboarding many of our Docker applications onto our Kubernetes cluster.
                                </p>
                                <p>     The next chapter of my life took me back to the defense sector at Rebellion Defense. An old manager I trust
                                    reached out wanting to collaborate once more in the defense space. We both knew it had its challenges, but we
                                    were determined to make waves in a sector that craves innovation. While my time was brief at Rebellion, I felt as
                                    if my impact was known. During my tenure, I was part of every offline and online deployment of our Software-as-a-Service
                                    offering, flying to and from customer sites to ensure a frictionless deployment; I helped migrate portions of our Gitlab
                                    Infrastructure-as-Code to GitHub; I collaborated with the InfoSec and Engineering teams to improve and iterate on our deployment
                                    process.
                                </p>
                                <p>     What's next? Well, that chapter has yet to be written!
