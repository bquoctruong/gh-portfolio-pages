I wanted to create a space where I can publish what I have been working to achieve over the last couple of months.
As a DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer by trade, what we do is rarely visible or tangible to the majority of our clients.
My personal belief is that if the infrastructure is up, we've been working hard to ensure that it stays that way to maintain
the coveted 99.999999% uptime SLA. However, this doesn't always translate to common metrics associated with success. While
I'm mostly content with the personal gratification of fulfilling my role, the misinterpretation of how SRE success is measured
may lead to incredibly dire consequences, such as role reduction or being put on a PIP (Thankfully, I've yet to be a part of either).
