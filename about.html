            <h2>DevOps Engineer with humble beginnings!</h2>
            <p>     It all started with just about any job right out of university; I just wanted to get a job, get paid, and live. 
                I moved to the high desert and started my career at the Department of Defense.
                However, life had other plans. I was paired with my new technical lead and he was truly an engineer of passion; 
                he had a love for the craft that changed my world view almost instantly. What started as a "9-5" routine 
                became "6-3"; early mornings, endless work, and we all did it to advance our technological boundaries at the time. 
                We pushed for cloud infrastructure, container orcehestration, proper CICD, all in the face of uncertainty and doubt.
            We enabled remote work for our small sector of engineers faster than the standard acquisition time. It was a golden era 
        of endless learning and execution. I walked away from here with passion for the craft of DevOps.</p>
        <p>     My next adventure took me to Utah to work for my first startup. We were a passionate group that 
            wanted to "empower the world to be financially strong". I hadn't resonated with a company mission as much
            as I did up until that point. I remembered leading a coding workshop early on with children from
            K-12 and leaving them with an application that would caculate how much to save from their paychecks
            in order to pay their taxes at the end of the year. I bet those kids thought it was pretty lame, but
            I wanted to leave them with something useful. It was a great 2 years and I accomplished so much with my
            team; we upgraded our binary storage to S3 (which enabled our Kubernetes team), we kept the platform up to our
            projected SLAs of 99.9% uptime, and we began our movement into a hybrid cloud infrastructure system with GCP.
