            <h2>DevOps Engineer with humble beginnings!</h2>
            <p>It all started with just about any job right out of university; I just wanted to get a job, get paid, and live. 
                However, life had other plans. I was paired with my new technical lead and he was truly an engineer of passion; he had a love for the craft that changed my world view almost instantly.</p>
            <p>What started as a "9-5" routine became "6-3"; early mornings, endless work, and we all did it to advance our technological boundaries at the time. We pushed for cloud infrastructure, container orcehestration, proper CICD, all in the face of uncertainty.</p>
