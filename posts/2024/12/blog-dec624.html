						<h2>End of the Year Roundup</h2>
						<p>December 6, 2024</p>
					</header>
					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p> Well, well, well, if it isn't the perfect time to deliver an update despite not being super
						consistent in updating this space.
						2024 marked my first whole year in true unemployment. While I had geared up to re-enter the job
						market at the turn of the year, life had different plans
						for me.
					</p>
					<p> Earlier this year, I held down the fort at my parent's business while they returned to their
						home country to take care of their grandparents. Working at
						a service level again really put into perspective how far I had came along in my entire career
						history; you're never too old to be humbled once again working service.
						What this actually affected was time put into DSA, personal projects, etc., resulting in a
						pretty late start to the job search. Below, I want to break down how this year went regarding
						those topics.
					</p>
					<h3>DSA, a.k.a., LeetCode</h3>
					<p> I believe my earlier attempts to "grind" LeetCode were rather inefficient. Just blindly doing
						problems, whether formatted in LC 75, HackerRank lists, etc., did not provide the results
						I was looking for. It wasn't until I discovered NeetCode, who broke down the most effective
						manner in tackling problems. This breakdown, as well as properly tracking time, pass/fail, and
						recording
						takeaways resulted in more effective practice. One of my recent interviews was with a
						MAANG-company, and I was proud that my score improved rather dramatically compared to what I
						recalled from previous tests.
					</p>
					<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
					One of my core goals this year was to deploy a project across multiple public clouds in order to
					emulate a production environment.
					<p>
						The biggest project I wanted to have done was a proper sandbox to intermittent QA to production
						GitHub Actions pipeline that would emulate a real production stack. The value in doing this at a
						non-production level cannot be understated; reducing second-guessing on whether a
						change would broadly affect production enables swift delivery and drastically lowers
						time-to-production by a significant margin. While most people default to pushing to main (I am
						guilty of this) on personal projects, it's important to maintain proper Git
						etiquitte for the future.</p>
